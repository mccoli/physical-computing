# README
# introduction
This is an interactive piece of art that takes the user's touch as an 
input and uses servos and a NeoPixel LED ring as outputs. The servos 
rotate the flowers.

# installation
To use this you must have access to an Arduino Editor with the following 
libaries installed:
- Adafruit Neopixel
- MPR121

# how to use
Arrange all the components as you please without disrupting the 
connections. Make sure the conductive materials are on a non-conductive 
surface, or else it will cause random behaviour. Touch the conductive 
materials to cause movement and lights in the sculpture.

# how to modify
You can alter the pattern displayed on the NeoPixel by substituting the 
rainbow function for another one of the examples, or write your own. 

# credits
I combined these two creations together to create the bolt to servo 
attachment.
